# AWS SSO CLI

## Description

Switch between temporary AWS SSO credentials of all your AWS accounts using the command-line. Using the official AWS Cli v2, it is required to create a profile for _each_ account, which is not practical if you're working with a big (growing) list of accounts and/or multiple instances of AWS SSO.

## Features

- Generates temporary AWS SSO credentials from the commandline
- Configure SSO profiles for jumping between different instances of AWS SSO
- Re-authenticates whenever the access token becomes invalid
- Interactively prompts for Profiles/Accounts/Roles if not supplied through options
- Ability to open web console of selected account

## Requirements

- Node.js **v14** or higher

## Setup

Install with npm:

```bash
npm install -g aws-sso-cli
```

By default, the utility prints out the `export` statements for the credentials (similar to the web frontend). If you want to have them exported automatically, you can set up a function in your .bashrc or .zshrc file that can run the export commands like so:

```bash
aws-sso-cli() {
  local tmp_file=$(mktemp)
  command aws-sso-cli "$@" > "$tmp_file"
  while IFS= read -r line; do
    if [[ "$line" =~ 'export AWS_' ]]; then
      eval "$line"
    fi
  done < "$tmp_file"
  rm "$tmp_file"
}
```
